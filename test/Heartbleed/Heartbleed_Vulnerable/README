# Protecting Heartbleed with PopSGX

To replicate the vulnerability, you can run the example server of the vulnerable
OpenSSL version, by doing:

```
$ cd openssl_src
$ ./config
$ make -j<threads>
$ cd apps
$ ./openssl s_server
```
since you don't specify port, the connections accepted will be on port 4433.
Hence, go to the example client and run the attack:

```
$ cd  heartbleed-client
$ gcc -o heart heartbleed.c
$ ./heart 127.0.0.1 4433
```
